# RESTful API Master
A starter project for implementing a RESTful API with Node.js using ES6. Key features include:

- Adoption of the Hexagonal Architecture to organize the application into logical layers with clearly defined responsibilities.  
- Implementation of RESTful APIs using the Express framework.  
- An in-memory repository layer is used for persistence, which can be easily replaced with any preferred persistence technology.  
- MSSQL and MySQL adapters are provided for flexibility in connecting to a database. Update database credentials in the `.env` file as needed.
